# jfxtend
A minimalist Scala Library to make extending JavaFX easier. Unlike ScalaFX, this library does not wrap JavaFX. You 
still create your JavaFX objects and use JavaFX methods and values. What jfxtend does is provide syntactic sugar to 
make using JavaFX easier, and provide a variety of functional extensions to JavaFX.
